NQP JVM Preparation Roadmap

This provides an idea of the things that need to be worked on, very roughly
sorted by priority. Currently, quite a lot of the NQP test suite passes. The
goal now is to get the grammar engine ported, then work through HLL, the
grammar for regexes, getting the QAST -> JAST cross-compile to compile itself,
then getting NQP self-hosting.

QAST to JAST Compiler
* xor
* chain

Exceptions
* Design work
* Runtime support
* QAST::Op handle
* Various other exception related instructions

Context Introspection
* Tests for what's implemented so far
* Finish up lexpad fiddling

6model
* BoolificationSpec - method and bigint cases
* ContainerSpec
* Type check handling (fallback case)
* Work something out for bigint REPR

SCs
* Serialization

Parsing
* NFA execution
* Missing regex ops: rxpeek and rxcommit
* Handling of cursor stack in backtracking
* Backtracking into subrules
* alt
* altseq
* anchor
* conjseq
* quant
* subcapture
* subrule
* uniprop
