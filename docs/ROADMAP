NQP JVM Preparation Roadmap

This provides an idea of the things that need to be worked on, very roughly
sorted by priority. Currently, quite a lot of the NQP test suite passes. The
current goals are to cross-compile the HLL library, then the grammar for
regexes, get the QAST -> JAST cross-compiler to compile itself, then get NQP
self-hosting.

QAST to JAST Compiler
* xor
* chain

Exceptions
* Handling try as an expression
* rethrow
* resume
* Various other exception related instructions

Context Introspection
* Tests for what's implemented so far
* Finish up lexpad fiddling

6model
* BoolificationSpec - bigint case
* ContainerSpec
* Type check handling (fallback case)
* Work something out for bigint REPR

SCs
* Serialization
