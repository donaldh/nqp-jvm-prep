NQP JVM Preparation Roadmap

Grouped by topic, but there are plenty of dependencies between compiler and
runtime. Sort-of in order within the groups. This won't get us all the way to
being able to cross-compile NQP to JVM, but it'll most certainly get a lot of
what is needed.

Minimal QAST to JAST Compiler
* QAST::Stmt as an allocation boundary
* Basic flow control ops
* Basic 6model ops
* QAST::Var lexicals and contextuals
* Parameters
* Return values
* QAST::Want

6model
* Design work for REPRs
* REPR registry
* P6int, P6num, P6str REPRs
* VMHash, VMArray REPRs
* KnowHOWREPR, KnowHOW bootstrap
* P6opaque REPR

Runtime
* Design work for calling conventions
* Design work for lexicals and callframes
* Implement required call frame and arg passing bits
* Implement ops for lexical handling
* Implement various 6model ops

SCs
* Design work for SC support
* Deserialization implementation
* QAST::WVal

Parsing
* NFA execution
* Ops for regexes
* Work out how backtracking will work (probably jumplist)
* Compilation of QAST::Regex
