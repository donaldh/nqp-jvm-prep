NQP JVM Preparation Roadmap

This provides an idea of the things that need to be worked on. Once all these
are done, we'll have most of what is needed to start working on cross-compiling
NQP to the JVM. (And yes, this means working for a quite a while with just QAST
trees to test.) There are some dependencies between the various sections (like,
some of the QAST things need runtime support).

QAST to JAST Compiler
* Remaining positional ops (splice, delete)
* Loops
* QAST::Var contextuals
* Flattening arguments
* Closures
* Named lexical lookup fallback
* String ops (for now, we'll just go with JVM strings to Make Something Work,
  but in the future we'll have to re-visit this and do NFG...)

6model
* Work something out for bigint REPR

Runtime
* Implementation of flattening args
* Implement ops for lexical handling by name
* Implement various 6model related ops

SCs
* Design work for SC support
* Deserialization implementation
* QAST::WVal

Exceptions
* Design work
* Runtime support
* QAST::Op handle
* Various other exception related instructions

Contexts
* Contexts as first class things (REPR...)
* QAST instructions for it

Parsing
* NFA execution
* Ops for regexes
* Work out how backtracking will work (probably jumplist)
* Compilation of QAST::Regex
