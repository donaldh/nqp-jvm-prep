NQP JVM Preparation Roadmap

This provides an idea of the things that need to be worked on, very roughly
sorted by priority. The overall goal is to get to a cross-compiled MOP, module
loader and minimal setting, then start attempting the test suite. This will in
turn exercise further things needing implementation, such as regex handling.

QAST to JAST Compiler
* Remaining positional ops (existspos, deletepos)
* QAST::VarWithFallback
* Remaining string ops (of note, split and join)
* xor
* nqp::stat
* HLL global stash (needs nqp:: op'ing some stuff in NQP)
* Some kind of bytecode loading abstraction

Exceptions
* Design work
* Runtime support
* QAST::Op handle
* Various other exception related instructions

Contexts
* Contexts as first class things (REPR...)
* QAST instructions for it

6model
* BoolificationSpec - method and bigint cases
* ContainerSpec
* Type check handling
* Work something out for bigint REPR

SCs
* P6opaque deserialization
* Closure and context deserialization
* Serialization

Parsing
* NFA execution
* Ops for regexes
* Work out how backtracking will work (probably jumplist)
* Compilation of QAST::Regex
* alt
* altseq
* anchor
* cclass
* concat
* cong
* conjseq
* dba
* enumcharlist
* literal
* pass
* qastnode
* quant
* scan
* subcapture
* subrule
