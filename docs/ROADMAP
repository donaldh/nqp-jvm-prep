NQP JVM Preparation Roadmap

Grouped by topic, but there are plenty of dependencies between compiler and
runtime. Sort-of in order within the groups. This won't get us all the way to
being able to cross-compile NQP to JVM, but it'll most certainly get a lot of
what is needed.

Minimal QAST to JAST Compiler
* null, ifnull
* loops
* Basic 6model ops
* QAST::Var lexicals and contextuals
* Parameters
* Return values

6model
* Design work for REPRs
* REPR registry
* P6int, P6num, P6str REPRs
* VMHash, VMArray REPRs
* KnowHOWREPR, KnowHOW bootstrap
* P6opaque REPR

Runtime
* Design work for calling conventions
* Design work for lexicals and callframes
* Implement required call frame and arg passing bits
* Implement ops for lexical handling
* Implement various 6model ops

SCs
* Design work for SC support
* Deserialization implementation
* QAST::WVal

Strings
* Decide what to do about them
* Implement it
* Add the various QAST ops related to strings

Exceptions
* Design work
* Runtime support
* QAST::Op handle
* Various other exception related instructions

Contexts
* Contexts as first class things (REPR...)
* QAST instructions for it

Extra QAST bits
* Missing trig instructions
* Other missing numeric instructions

Parsing
* NFA execution
* Ops for regexes
* Work out how backtracking will work (probably jumplist)
* Compilation of QAST::Regex
